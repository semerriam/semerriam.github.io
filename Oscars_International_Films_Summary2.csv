It's amazing. Wow.This is a film about letting go of control in life, as I lost control in my own. And I want to thank my wife Helene, who sits over here, for being the angel of this project, for guiding me through this very difficult period. I want to thank my children, my family:  Nanna, Ida, Albert, Lily. My screenwriter Tobias Lindholm, who's my guardian angel in both living and writing, I'm sending you my praises. There's a lot of people to thank but I'll, I'll get there. I'm sending my praises to Zentropa, Sisse, Kasper, Peter, Feder, Kornum, all of you. You had so much heart, so much strength at the same time. The crew, who threw everything they had in their hands to rescue me, and rescued this film. The investors, my agents, distributors. Samuel Goldwyn, Bart Walker, all of you, Christina Bazdekis, Jessica Sykes, Bumble. You're all there. Cinetic, thank you for showing the bravery of investing in a movie that is about four depraved white drunk men, basically. Who teaches children to drink, as well. I mean, pretty uphills in my perspective. Those four white men being Magnus Millang, Lars Ranthe, Thomas Bo Larsen, my old friend – the whole cast, you were brilliant. Susse, Maria, all of you, took out your hearts for this and were brilliant. I want to send a special thank, of course, to Mads Mikkelsen, [exclaims!], Mads Mikkelsen. Yeah, give him a hand. Mads, you gave us your finest. Not just for the film, but for my daughter as well. And I'll never forget.Okay, so we wanted to make a film that celebrates life, and four days into shooting the impossible happens. An accident on a highway took my daughter away. Someone looking into his cell phone. And we miss her and I love her. And… sorry. Two months before we shot this movie and two months before she died, she was in Africa. She sent me a letter. And she'd just read the script and she was glowing with excitement. She loved this. And she felt seen by this. And she was supposed to be in this. And if anyone dares to believe that she's here with us somehow, she – you'll be able to see her clapping and cheering with us. We ended up making this movie for her, as her monument. So, Ida, this is a miracle that just happened. And you're a part of this miracle. Maybe you've been pulling some strings somewhere, I don't know, but this one is for you. Thank you very much."

Film: The Tin Drum
Acceptance Speech— 
VOLKER SCHLÖNDORFF: The hero of ""The Tin Drum,"" you know, is named ""Oskar,"" and for all the time we were making the film we wondered what kind an omen this could be.  So, this what it's meant.  It's a little boy actor, he has in common with this one [referring to the statuette] of being small but only in size.You know, it's the first award ever given to a film of my country.  There's been lots of reasons for that we know, but I take it as a tribute also for my fellow directors over there and for all those whose tradition we want to pick up and follow and who worked and lived here.  I mean Fritz Lang, Billy Wilder, Lubitsch, Murnau, Pabst.  You know them all; you welcomed them.  Thank you.

ANOUSHEH ANSARI: I will be reading a statement by Mr. Farhadi:  It's a great honor to be receiving this valuable award for the second time. I would like to thank the members of the Academy, my crew in Iran, my producer Alexandre Mallet-Guy, Cohen Media, Amazon and my fellow nominees in the foreign film category. I'm sorry I'm not with you tonight. My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of other six nations whom have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S. Dividing the world into the us and our enemies categories creates fear, a deceitful justification for aggression and war. These wars prevent democracy and human rights in countries which have themselves been victims of aggression. Filmmakers can turn their cameras to capture shared human qualities and break stereotypes of various nationalities and religions. They create empathy between us and others, an empathy which we need today more than ever.Thank you on behalf of Mr. Farhadi. Thank you."

It was that very Oscar which marked the beginning of the global acceptance of that film which was produced against the advice of many.  ""The Garden of Finzi Continis"" was made by Vittorio De Sica, Gianni Hecht Lucari and myself against similar advice.  We were warned that a film without any sex and without any violence, dealing in a subtle manner with a tragic chapter of mankind is a doomed venture.  Tonight, again, the Academy has given hope and inspiration to independent film producers everywhere to go ahead with their projects as long as they sincerely believe in them.  On behalf of all connected with ""The Garden of Finzi Continis,"" and also on behalf of those independent film producers out there, I humbly thank you.GIANNI HECHT LUCARI: Thank you.
