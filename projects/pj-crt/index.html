								<h2>
									So, How Did We Get Here?
								</h2>	


								<p data-paragraph="main">
									The public’s definition of critical race theory has undergone a transformation from a field of legal study to a catch-all term for everything dealing with systemic racism and equality in America. Legal scholars originally conceived of critical race theory as a framework for identifying racism in institutions. Over the past year, however, conservative pundits on Fox News have defined critical race theory as an attempt by liberals to label individuals as inherently racist. 
								</p>

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									Now, <a href="https://americarenewing.com/issues/list-critical-race-theory-buzzwords/" target="_blank"><u style="text-decoration-color:grey">broad terms</u></a> like 'equity', 'diversity and inclusion', or 'cultural awareness' have now also been equated with CRT by some Fox News anchors, elected officials, and everyday citizens.
								</p>

								<h2>
									A Fox News Editorial Priority
								</h2>	

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									An analysis of television and online news coverage shows that Fox News repeatedly mentioned critical race theory for months before other major news outlets referenced the topic. Since May 2020, Fox News mentioned CRT over five times more than CNN and MSNBC and published 1,060 articles that mentioned the phrase, the most out of any major news outlet, according to television news transcripts from the <a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?d=iatv" target="_blank"><u style="text-decoration-color:grey">Internet TV News Archive</u></a> and articles in the <a href="https://mediacloud.org/" target="_blank"><u style="text-decoration-color:grey">Media Cloud</u></a> database. Popular shows, FOX and Friends and The Ingraham Angle have talked about critical race theory over 500 and 300 times respectively. 
								</p>

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									Their coverage has frequently propagated fear-inducing claims that schools have been shaming, brainwashing and ultimately harming children across the nation. 
								</p>

								<h2>

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									And just a couple of weeks later critical race theory was introduced onto the Fox News mainstage by one of its hosts—Laura Ingraham.

								</p>

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									Ingraham went on to say that in years past, Republicans and Democrats had dismissed the academic concept of critical race theory. “Today those theories are mainstream,” she said. “I think what we’re seeing now from the left is the result of, <a href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20200611_060000_The_Ingraham_Angle/start/1893/end/1928#" target="_blank"><u style="text-decoration-color:grey">I think it’s just decades of critical race theory</u></a> [and] grievance studies infecting our schools and our culture.”
								</p>


								<p data-paragraph="main">
									While Ingraham had claimed critical race theory was mainstream, Fox had mentioned the phrase only a handful of times in the several years prior. 
								</p>

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									Ingraham’s segment was part of the beginning of what would become a steady stream of critical race theory coverage on Fox. From July 8 through July 28 of 2020, Ingram and Tucker Carlson hosted four different experts who discussed how “critical race theory is <a href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20200724_020000_The_Ingraham_Angle/start/3111/end/3146#" target="_blank"><u style="text-decoration-color:grey">incredibly pervasive</u></a> in the American education system” and that “ideological extremism [was] <a href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20200709_020000_The_Ingraham_Angle/start/693/end/728#" target="_blank"><u style="text-decoration-color:grey">infiltrating and indoctrinating</u></a> our children.”

									05/2021 ⁠–⁠ 08/2021: CRT Coverage Reaches its Peak During Summer Months
									</h2>	

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									From May to early August this year, the exposure on Fox about CRT steadily rose both on television and online. Mentions of the term critical race theory in broadcasts more than doubled from the month before. Fox News mentioned CRT over 700 times in May compared to CNN’s 70 and MSNBC’s 90. 


								</p>

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									In their coverage, Fox started featuring school board meetings, highlighting tensions between parents and teachers and the alleged indoctrination of children.
								</p>

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									“All over the country beginning last June school curricula have changed completely and become explicitly political and openly racist,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJjnpjJnb9E" target="_blank"><u style="text-decoration-color:grey">claimed Tucker Carlson</u></a> on his May 18 broadcast, “and most parents have just sat there on their hands and watched it happen and watched their kids hurt by it.”
								</p>

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									He then featured a mother whose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJjnpjJnb9E" target="_blank"><u style="text-decoration-color:grey">speech against CRT</u></a> at a school committee meeting in Loudoun County, Virginia, had <a href="https://twitter.com/iandprior/status/1392292044975087617" target="_blank"><u style="text-decoration-color:grey">gone viral on Twitter</u></a> a few days before.
								</p>

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									In one of the most violent segments we reviewed,<a href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20210525_070000_The_Ingraham_Angle/start/3000/end/3060" target="_blank"><u style="text-decoration-color:grey"> Laura Ingraham cited</u></a> an “explosive exposé” by Rufo claiming public schools in Portland were raising "child soldiers." She subsequently played a graphic video of someone pushing a white man down on the ground and a supposed 14-year-old kicking him in the face. The video showed the man’s bloody face and someone saying "knocked this motherf***er out" and “Black lives matter you, f*****!”

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									Ingraham then introduced a smiling Rufo and asked, “why should every American be concerned across the country about the indoctrination going on in the schools there?”
								</p>

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									Rufo responded saying that Portland schools had adopted “The Pedagogy of the Oppressed,” a 1970s Brazilian curriculum with roots in social justice. Simultaneously, a video played next to him showing two men wearing helmets, safety vests and combat boots walk in a street shrouded in smoke and explosions.
								</p>

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									In May, at least 15 different protests against CRT cropped up in 12 US states. In Georgia, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/education/opposition-to-critical-race-theory-intensifies-in-georgia/FKXKJELVIBHX3KCWZLVDQNWAAY/" target="_blank"><u style="text-decoration-color:grey">hundreds gathered</u></a> outside of a school board meeting in Craven County to protest critical race theory in schools, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. As a result the board reportedly halted its plans to implement a “diversity, equity and inclusion” program.

								</p>

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									In June, Fox’s written coverage reached its peak, totaling 275 articles published that mention critical race theory, and on television the phrase was mentioned over 1,200 times. Over 50 protests took place in 25 different states that month, according to ACLED. Nearly half favored CRT. North Carolina alone saw six total demonstrations on both sides of the debate. In New Hampshire there were five.

								<h2>
									Competing Networks Cover CRT
								</h2>	
	

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									As protests and legal action escalated during the summer months, competing networks CNN and MSNBC dramatically increased their coverage, though the networks still did not mention the term as often as Fox.
								</p>


								<p data-paragraph="main">
									CNN and MSNBC used airtime to try to debunk the statements made by Fox. For instance, on June 28 Joy Reid hosted the historian Ibram X. Kendi and author of “How to Be an Antiracist.” In the <a href="https://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20210628_230000_The_ReidOut#start/2748/end/2783" target="_blank"><u style="text-decoration-color:grey">segment of “The Reid Out,”</u></a> she asked Kendi direct questions like if he believed "white Americans are inherently racist,"—a phrase repeatedly used by Fox to define the tenets of critical race theory—or if he knew of "any school teaching that white Americans are inherently racist.” Kendi’s response was a blank "no.”
								</p>

								<h2>
									The Right Wing Ecosystem
								</h2>	

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									In the summer, coverage surrounding CRT started to extensively focus on education. Across right-leaning media outlets, the topic of critical race theory became more common following many months of limited coverage. Previously, it was only mentioned on rare occasions, according to an analysis of online media coverage using <a href="https://mediacloud.org/" target="_blank"><u style="text-decoration-color:grey">Media Cloud</u></a>. 
									
									Fox News’ written coverage grew significantly in June, reaching a peak of 275 articles published that mentioned “critical race theory” at least in one sentence. That figure equaled 5.3 percent of the total number of stories published that month, followed closely by the Daily Caller (with 4.3 percent) and only surpassed by The Federalist, whose stories mentioning CRT climbed up to 14 percent in June.

									Tom Hosler, a superintendent of an Ohio school district, told us in an interview that critical race theory has been a focus for some parents in his district— “we've had a hard time kind of combating and defining what it is and what it is not.”

								<p data-paragraph="main">

									In Summary
								</h2>

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									The critical race theory debate in the U.S. has been a matter of definitions: defining a person’s identity, defining American history, defining the phrase itself.
								</p>


								<p data-paragraph="main">
									Fox News was the first network to focus its attention on redefining and identifying critical race theory for its audience. In the year-and-a-half since the conversation started, the organization published about and discussed this topic more than any other news organization.  
								</p>


								<p data-paragraph="main">
									From a media perspective, today the phrase has become commonplace on many different networks and publications. Dozens of protests have taken place in nearly 70 cities across the U.S. 
								</p>

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2681240205455108/?hoisted_section_header_type=recently_seen&multi_permalinks=3094625357449922" target="_blank"><u style="text-decoration-color: grey">Thousands of parents</u></a> are worried about what their children are being taught. Over seventy pieces of legislation have been crafted that seek to define what children should or shouldn't be exposed to in schools. And now that school boards across the country have seats up for election on November 2, the debate could even define the agendas of school leadership nationwide.

									Process
								</h2>

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									In October 2021, Shelby Jouppi, Patricia Martinez-Sastre and I worked on a data project analyzing major network coverage of "critical race theory" in comparison to the timing of lawmakers introduction of legislation, "anti-CRT" protests, and Chris Rufo appearances on Fox News. 
								</p>

								<p data-paragraph="main">
									We used media coverage data gathered from the Internet TV News Archive via the GDELT Project, ACLED's events data, and legislation data from trackers by the Brookings Institution and Chris Rufo.
								</p>
							


								<p data-paragraph="main">
									The ultimate goal is to make the timeline interactive by using d3 and scrollytelling to walk a reader through the timeline. Below is a static version of what it will hopefully look like.
